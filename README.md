This repository will contain the supplementary materials to the paper on neural machine translation for the Erzya language. 

# Deliverables
These delivarables are released as supplementary materials to the paper:
- Dirty code for the paper: in the folder `dirty-code-2022`.
    - The code is *really dirty*, because it is contained in the notebooks 
        that depend on missing directories 
        and sometimes have non-direct order of execution.
    - It is intended not for full reproducibility, but just for demonstrating 
    the implementation of some ideas mentioned in the paper.   
- More reproducible code: will be added later. 
- Demo translation app: https://huggingface.co/spaces/slone/myv-translation-2022-demo
